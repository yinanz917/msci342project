## About Zoommates 🚀 💛
Zoommates is a platform that helps students find a roommate that they enjoy living with who could also potentially be a great friend. We aim to create a system that helps better facilitate the roommate search process so that we can help connect students who share similar interests and lifestyles. 🍃

Zoommates allows you to create your own personal profile with details about your hobbies and lifestyle, along with a Zoommate profile where you can specify what you look for in a roommate. From there, we'll match the two profiles and show you the best matches for you in a fun and engaging way!
